OnStep Smart Hand Controller
===========================

# What is a smart hand controller (SHC)?
This firmware is designed to run on a Teensy3.2 micro-controller which communicates with OnStep across the ST4 guiding port to provide
setup and control of most features.  While you can point to point wire/assemble you own design many will opt for the inexpensive EasyEDA PCB
who's schematic serves as wiring instructions for those who choose a more complete DIY experience :)
